## Project Overview

This repository contains a multi-year research project examining the relationship between fertility rates and life expectancy in the United States. What began as a sophomore-year undergraduate honors modeling project has since evolved into a senior-year and graduate-level research effort focused on statistical and time-series modeling, with ongoing work aimed toward academic publication.

The project investigates long-run demographic trends using publicly available U.S. data from 1960–2023 and demonstrates the progression of modeling techniques, computational tools, and research depth over time.

## Project Timeline and Scope

### Undergraduate Research (Sophomore Year – 2024)
- Initial research question: modeling fertility rate as a function of life expectancy
- Empirical model comparison including:
  - Polynomial models (1st–6th order)
  - Logarithmic, exponential, and power models
- Modeling and simulation conducted primarily in **Excel**
- Paper written and typeset in **LaTeX** as part of an undergraduate honors mathematical modeling course

Materials from this stage are located in the **`UndergraduateWork/`** folder.

---

### Senior Year / Graduate Research (2024–Present)
- Expansion of the project into a more rigorous computational and statistical framework
- Implementation of analysis and modeling in **Python**
- Refinement of methodology, validation, and interpretation
- Development of presentation materials for academic audiences
- Ongoing extensions and refinements toward journal submission as part of graduate research

Core materials from this stage are located in the main project directories and include:
- Python analysis code
- Research presentation slides

Also included is the Poster Presentation of the research slides which was given to the Mathematics Department to promote department research.

## Undergraduate Paper Disclaimer

> **Important Note:**  
> Materials located in the `Undergraduate/` folder represent an early undergraduate honors project that initiated this research trajectory.  
> The methods, scope, and conclusions presented there reflect the tools and objectives at that stage of study and have since been substantially extended and refined in ongoing senior-level and graduate-level research.  
> To avoid duplication with developing manuscripts, only finalized undergraduate materials are included.
